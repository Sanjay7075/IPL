💡 Today's IPL Data Insights from Interactive Dashboard

🚀 I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze all IPL teams' win percentages, toss decisions, and match trends!

📊 Key Findings:
✅ Winning Consistency: The dashboard highlights that teams like Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Delhi Capitals, Punjab Kings, Gujarat Titans, and Lucknow Super Giants have varied win rates based on seasons.
✅ Toss Impact: Teams winning the toss often choose to chase rather than set a target.
✅ Venue Influence: Some stadiums have a higher chasing success rate than others, affecting match outcomes.
✅ Margin of Victory: Teams winning by big margins often dominate in the playoffs as well.

🔜 Next Step: Adding player-wise win contributions and head-to-head team comparisons!
